My Portfolio Website 

Just trying to make some pretty apps & websites ^_^ 

>> I know it looks pretty bad on mobile right now I'm sorry <<

I started with a bootstrap template, stripped content, added some new functionality, 
added a lot of fancy css/javascript (look for comments)

feel free to use this as a template for your website, 
I kindly ask that you'd remove any photos as they are copyrighted

main to-do: 
</br>optimize for mobile & tablet 
</br>add projects
